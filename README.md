MiniCompilerOnSteroids ‚Äì Documentation
This project implements an educational mini compiler developed by F√©lix Jos√© Blanco Cabrera (1-17-1693) as part of the Compilers course at UTESA, taught by Ivan Mendoza. The project is now known as MiniCompilerOnSteroids due to the adoption of Peggy for parsing and the enhanced error reporting (with line and column tracking).

üõ†Ô∏è Language and Tools
Primary Language: JavaScript (with HTML and CSS for the UI).

Parser Generator: Peggy (a modern fork of PEG.js) is used to generate the parser. It supports advanced features like line and column tracking for precise error reporting.

Lexical Analysis: A custom tokenizer (similar in concept to flex) handles tokenization.

Compiler Architecture: The compiler uses a recursive descent (LL-style) approach generated by Peggy, along with a semantic analyzer.

Platform: Web application ‚Äî runs in any modern browser without installation (simply open index.html).

‚ú® Key Features
‚úÖ Lexical Analysis: Identifies valid tokens and detects errors such as unknown symbols.

‚úÖ Syntactic Analysis: Uses the Peggy-generated parser to detect structural code errors.

‚úÖ Semantic Analysis: Checks for issues like variable redeclaration and type mismatches.

‚úÖ Error Reporting: Provides detailed error messages with line and column information.

‚úÖ Symbol Table Display: Lists found identifiers along with their types and positions.

‚úÖ Basic Code Translation: Translates JavaScript code to another language (e.g., a basic PHP conversion).

‚úÖ Modern Interface: Features a dark-themed UI with organized panels and drop-down menus.

‚úÖ Open Source: Contributions are encouraged to help improve the compiler further.

üìÇ File Structure
index.html:
The main user interface. It organizes the workspace into sections for source code input, translated output, error messages, and a symbol table.

compiler.js:
Contains the core logic of the compiler, including lexical, syntactic, and semantic analysis, code generation, and console logging.

grammar.js:
The parser file generated by Peggy. This file provides robust error reporting with line and column tracking. Note: Every time you modify your grammar, check the end of this file and change the wrapper from })(this); to })(window); to ensure it runs properly in a browser.

grammar.peggy:
The source file for the grammar. You modify this file when you need to change language features, such as adding new constructs or fixing parsing issues (like the for-loop variable declaration and triple equals === handling).

style.css:
(Optional) Contains styles to improve the visual layout of the application.

README.md:
Documentation and an overview of the project.

üî® Modifying and Rebuilding the Parser
MiniCompilerOnSteroids is built with an open and flexible grammar. To modify the parser:

Edit the Grammar:
Open grammar.peggy in your text editor and make the desired changes. For example, you might add new rules or fix existing ones (such as handling in-line variable declarations in a for-loop or supporting ===).

Delete the Old Generated Parser:
Remove the previous grammar.js file (or overwrite it) to ensure you‚Äôre working with a clean version.

Rebuild with npx:
Use the following command (make sure Peggy is installed locally or globally) to rebuild your parser:

bash
Copy
npx peggy --format globals --export-var parser grammar.peggy -o grammar.js
This command tells Peggy to generate a global parser variable (named parser).

Modify the Parser Wrapper:
Open the newly generated grammar.js and scroll to the end of the file.
If the file ends with:

js
})(this);
change it to:

js
Copy
})(window);
This explicitly attaches the parser to the browser‚Äôs global object, ensuring that parser.parse(...) works correctly.

Use a Version File:
To avoid conflicts with Node versions, create an .nvmrc file in your project root (if you haven‚Äôt already) with your desired Node version (e.g., v20.14.0). This helps ensure that everyone working on the project uses the same Node version:

Copy
v20.14.0
üöß Known Issues and Future Work
While MiniCompilerOnSteroids is functional, there are some known weak points:

For-Loop Variable Declarations:
The grammar currently requires moving variable declarations (e.g., let i = 1) outside the for-loop header to avoid conflicts. Future improvements aim to allow in-line declarations.

Triple Equals (===):
There are some issues with parsing strict equality (===). This limitation will be addressed in upcoming versions.

Error Recovery:
Although error messages include line and column details, further improvements in error recovery and messaging are planned.

Expanded Language Features:
Additional constructs and optimizations are on the roadmap, with plans to support a broader subset of JavaScript features.

ü§ù Contribute
MiniCompilerOnSteroids is an open-source project and welcomes contributions from the community! Whether you want to improve the parser, refine the semantic analysis, add new language features, or polish the UI, your help is appreciated. Fork the repository, open issues, or submit pull requests to join us in taking this mini compiler to the next level.
